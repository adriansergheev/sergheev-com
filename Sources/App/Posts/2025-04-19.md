### A Rudimentary Blog in Swift with Build Tool Plugins
#### April 19, 2025

Swift is fun to write in. Wouldn't it be fun to write a *markdown.md* file, put it in the `Sources` folder, push the change, and *almost* have a live blog post?

It would, and it doesn't take much code at all!

For a primer on how to get past the Xcode ceremonies, see Apple's [Create Swift Package Plugins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110401/).

With that out of the way, here's how to collect all `.md` files from your app sources:

```swift
@main
struct MarkdownHTML: BuildToolPlugin {
  func createBuildCommands(
    context: PackagePlugin.PluginContext,
    target: any PackagePlugin.Target
  ) async throws -> [PackagePlugin.Command] {
    enum MarkdownHTMLError: Error {
      case failedToReadInputDirectory
    }
    guard let target = target as? SourceModuleTarget else {
      Diagnostics.emit(.error, "ðŸ”´ GenerateSwiftMarkdown failed")
      throw MarkdownHTMLError.failedToReadInputDirectory
    }
    return try target.sourceFiles(withSuffix: "md").map { file in
      let base = file.url.deletingPathExtension().lastPathComponent
      let input = file.url
      let output = context.pluginWorkDirectoryURL.appending(path: "\(base).swift")

      return .buildCommand(
        displayName: "Generating HTML from Markdown \(base)",
        executable: try context.tool(named: "MarkdownHTMLExec").url,
        arguments: [input.path, output.path],
        inputFiles: [input],
        outputFiles: [output]
      )
    }
  }
}

```
And here's the executable that runs Ink to parse Markdown into HTML:
```swift
let fileManager = FileManager.default
let arguments = ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments
if arguments.count < 3 {
  throw MarkdownHTMLExec.insufficientArguments
}
let (input, output) = (arguments[1], arguments[2])

let markdown = try String(contentsOfFile: input)
let parser = MarkdownParser()
let html = parser.html(from: markdown)

...

```
What's left is to grab that variable and [render](https://github.com/adriansergheev/sergheev-com/blob/04987fa8f0e628b693c994fc39c80037c2331634/Sources/App/Views/layout.swift) it. That's it!
