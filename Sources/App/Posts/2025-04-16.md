### Playing Guitar in the Semantic Apocalypse

I
--

Many years ago I used to play guitar. It was quite a serious endevour in the sense that I would spend hours and hours every day practicing, and It went like that for a few years. Yet besides being able to move up and down the fretboard at high speed and even convincing a then friend to buy a set of drums and form a band nothing really came out of it - at some point I just lost interest (and betrayed the friend who invested a summer or two alongside me). I almost forgot about this until recently when I got a guitar - now without the purpose of making it a career.

And only now I realised that I never really /played/ guitar but drilled exercises, tried to copy other artists styles without thinking of my own and especially - obsess over gear: pedals, sound, tube amps, coils, best strap-lock system and so on. I think at some point I knew more about how to fix the string height than where to play the same chord on the fretboard.

While my behaviour in my teens could be explained by documented cognitive biases such as [Overjustification effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect) or perhaps [Goal Displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal#Goal_displacement)  denoting a shift from intrinsic motivation (playing) to extrinsic motivation (social validation, making a career out of it) I can't stop wondering if I exhibit similar behaviour but towards other endevours today and I will be able to open my eyes 10 years or so in the future.

I've visited a friend recently which happened to have a guitar and saw that while years passed technology moved forward - and now there's things which make playing more accessible than ever. It seems to be that it became a lot more ok to play into headphones via something like a [Fender Mustang Micro Amp](https://eu.fender.com/products/mustang-micro) and just enjoy the act of playing. There was no smart strap-lock systems, or analogue pedal boards. There was no sight of tube amps in that apartment either. The sound wasn't my sound, but one could emulate a lot more of them effects than I ever would have been able to do out of my setup.

There was only one (favorite) guitar pick (which sometimes got lost) and a man playing guitar.

That reminded me of Scott Alexander's ["The colors of her coat"](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-colors-of-her-coat) which in turn was written as a response to ["Welcome to the semantic apocalypse"](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/welcome-to-the-semantic-apocalypse)
there Scott concurs that before syntethic ultramarine was discovered in the 19th century the "Perfect Platonic Blue" would be available only in a church - so rare was the pigment. Joe's single sight of this true blue not available anywhere else but the church would be a highlight of his life. 

I asked myself then, is playing guitar in a headphone amplifier with old strings with less than ideal headphones a betrayal of the vision that Fender or Les Paul had when they designed the modern electric guitar? Is the tube amp for me what ultramarine blue was for Joe?
Weren't these things designed to blast sound across stadiums? What if in the future all concerts are virtual?
What about LLMs being able to generate a full song? 
Is there less meaning to be drawn?

My only hope is that we will not.
